# EDOPro Booster Packs

This program is an extension of EDOPro (requiring it to run) that simulates the Yu-Gi-Oh!'s booster packs opening.
After close the program, you can check the drops into Booster Packs deck in your game 

‚ö†Ô∏è The drops are not yet properly adjusted. For now, it follows the format of **one rarity** per pack. 
Secret Rare and other rarities were considered Ultra Rares.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è:
- Download the exe or py (python 3 and pygame 2 required);
- Drop into your EDOPro folder;
- Double click it.
- Download and drop pics folder into your game to booster pack's cover and Duel Links rarity label;
